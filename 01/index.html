                                        Dear Prof. Price, <br>

                                        I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? <br>
                        </p>

                </div>

                <div class="text">
                        <h1>
                                Assignments
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                                 Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following: <br>      
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                        - Assignment 1 <br>
                                        - Assignment 2 <br>
                                       - All the rest of the assignments <br>
                        </ul>
                                
                        <h1>
                                Lectures
                        </h1>

                        <p>
                                Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on Rate My Little Pony <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/"></a>, and your ratings are pretty terrible.

                        </p>
                        <h1>
                                Course Website
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                                 I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird.  Do you mind if I just ignore this part?

                                 I look forward to a fruitful semester.
                        </p>
