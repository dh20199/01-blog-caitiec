# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

The semantic tags help to not only organize the page, but also helps later when styling the page using CSS. With different tags, you can use them to style certain sections rather than applying those styling changes to the entire page. It also helps in communication within the document in how the different parts interact with each other. By having sub categories, you are able to tell the page that certain parts fit inside of other parts giving them different levels of importance. It also helps by communicating with search engines to make sure that relevant results come up with certain queries.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.

Presentation is very important to ensure that the page is organized and easily readable. Without headings and titles it would be difficult to navigate the page, as well as find the necessary information that you are looking for. Especially when doing research, being able to find information quickly is very important. I find that in History especially, when doing research I am often just looking for a very key piece of information to enhance my essay, or to add to my argument. For example, say I was writing a paper about the Founding Fathers of the United States. I don't want to have to comb through paragraphs and paragraphs of information about their childhood, and personal lives, because my research and paper are solely focused on their role as a Founding Father. By having an organized page, I would be able to scroll through the majority of the text and look for the heading "political career" or something along those lines.
