            Alexander Hamilton was one of the original Founding Fathers and the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America. Born January 11 1755 in Charlestown, the capital of Newis (one of the British West Indies), he came to the colonies with money raised by his community after reading an essay he wrote. 
        He started out drilling with a company whilst still in school, worked as George Washingtonâ€™s aide, and eventually had his own field command. 
        He had a very successful career in Politics, establishing the U.S. Mint and the National Bank. He also worked with John Jay and James Madison, he wrote 51 out of the 85 published Federalist papers 
        In his personal life, he married Eliza Schuyler (one of the daughters of Philip Schuyler and Catherine Van Rensselaer) and had 8 children. He died in 1804 in a duel with Aaron Burr after being shot in the abdomen. 
        Today his story is well known in popular culture thanks to Lin Manuel-Miranda who wrote a rap musical about both his political and personal life. It first premiered on Broadway but has since toured in other cities including Chicago, London England and Toronto Canada coming in 2020.
